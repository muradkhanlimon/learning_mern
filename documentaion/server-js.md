# `app.listen(5000, () => { ... });`

This line tells the server to start listening for incoming requests on a specific port.

- **`app.listen(5000, ...)`**: The `app.listen()` method is used to make the Express application start a server and listen for incoming requests. The number `5000` is the port number where the server will listen for requests.
  
  - **`5000`**: This is the port number that the server will listen on. A port is like a "door" that network traffic enters through on a computer. When you visit a website (like `http://localhost:5000`), the server listens for requests on that specific port.

- **`() => { ... }`**: This is an arrow function that will run once the server has successfully started and is listening on the specified port. It’s a callback function to confirm that the server is running.

### `console.log("Server started at http://localhost:5000")`
This line is inside the arrow function. Once the server is up and running, it will print the message **"Server started at http://localhost:5000"** to the console (usually the terminal or command prompt). This message helps you know that the server is active and listening for requests.

### Putting it all together:
- **`app.listen(5000, ...)`** starts the server and makes it listen for requests on port 5000.
- When the server successfully starts, it will log **"Server started at http://localhost:5000"** to the console, so you know it's working.

So, this code makes the server run on your local machine, and you can visit `http://localhost:5000` in a browser to interact with the server.

Sure! Let's break it down step-by-step:

# 1. `app.get("/", (req, res) => { ... });`
This line defines a route for an HTTP GET request in an Express.js server.

- **`app`**: This refers to the Express application that you have created. It’s your server where you define routes and other logic.
  
- **`.get("/", ...)`**: This is saying, "When the server receives a GET request to the root URL (`"/"`) of the website, do something." The `"/"` means the homepage or the base URL of the app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/`).

- **`(req, res)`**: These are the parameters for the function you're defining. 
  - **`req` (request)**: It holds information about the incoming request, such as headers, query parameters, and body data.
  - **`res` (response)**: It’s the object you’ll use to send a response back to the client (the browser or whoever made the request).

- **`=> { ... }`**: This is an arrow function, a shorthand way to define a function. Inside the curly braces `{ ... }`, you’ll define what happens when the route is accessed.

### 2. `res.send("Server is ready.");`
This line sends a response to the client. In this case, the server responds with the message `"Server is ready."` when someone visits the root URL.

### Putting it all together:
When someone makes a GET request (like visiting `http://localhost:3000/`), the server will respond with the text **"Server is ready."**

So in summary, this code is a simple route handler for the home page of an Express app. It tells the server to reply with "Server is ready." when the user visits the root URL.
